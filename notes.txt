Next step:
- convert the process to write to a database (sqlite3?)
- need someway to confirm that no duplicates get added

Done last session:
- games.db script made and created
- players.db script made and created

TODO:
- Create floaters.db with all stats necessary
- Create kicks.db with all stats necessary
- confirm that no duplicates get added
- Modify games_table_update.py so that it actually updates instead of
        creating from scratch each time
- Send SMS with updates on Floaters
- attach links to videos for floaters
